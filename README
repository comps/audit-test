Audit Test Project
------------------

This README provides an overview of the available documentation in the Audit
Test Project.

Audit Test Project was initially created as a test suite for testing the kernel
audit subsystem [1] and related security functionality of software which interacts
with it. This includes SELinux, PAM, OpenSSH, Libreswan, CUPS, xinetd, KVM,
subsystems of the Linux kernel itself and more. Part of the testing coverage is
taken from the LTP test suite which is not related to audit in any way.

The documentation is scattered into few files:

* audit-test/README.run
You should start here if you want to run the tests in this project.
It will you valuable information how to setup and run all tests
in audit test suite (including LTP).

* audit-test/README.develop
Development notes worth reading before you start developing new tests.

* audit-test/README.netfilter
Networking needs a special setup for some tests to work. You should get
to this README from README.run.

* audit-test/README.netwk_svr

should help you setting it up.

* audit-test/README.ipa
