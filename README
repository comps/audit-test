Audit Test Project
------------------

This README provides an overview of the available documentation in the Audit
Test Project.

Audit Test Project was initially created as a test suite for testing the kernel
audit subsystem [1] and related security functionality of software which
interacts with it. This includes SELinux, PAM, OpenSSH, Libreswan, CUPS, xinetd
subsystems of the Linux kernel itself and more. Part of the testing coverage is
taken from the LTP test suite which is not related to audit in any way.

The documentation is scattered into few files:

 * audit-test/README.run
This is the starting point of the documentation. Following this README you will
be able to configure the test environment, install and configure the audi-test
suite and LTP suite and execute all the tests.

 * audit-test/README.netfilter

 * audit-test/README.netwk_svr
Dedicated to the installation and configuration of the Network Server - NS.

 * audit-test/README.ipa
Installation and configuration of the IPA server is described in this README.

 * audit-test/README.develop

for the audit test suite.
