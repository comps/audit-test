About netfilter/netfilebt tests
-------------------------------

The netfilter tests reside in the sub-directories netfilter and netfilebt of
the audit-test suite. The tests of the iptables and ip6tables reside in
netfilter, and the bridge table filtering tests are in netfilebt. The use
of remote network server running the lblnet_tst_server is required for these
tests.

The iptables and ip6tables tests have a large number of the tests that run
over the local loopback device to a locally running lblnet_tst_server
process.  Some of the tests for iptables and ip6tables are run over the
primary Ethernet device against the remote server executing the
lblnet_tst_server process.  The lblnet_tst_server on both systems is
launched from xinetd.

The lblnet_tst_server is configured on the TOE during the 'make netconfig'
procedure described in the README.run file.  Refer to the README.netwk_svr
for instructions on how to setup the network test server.

Network configuration
---------------------

To run the netfilter tests you need to configure two separate networks between
TOE and network test server (referred to as the netserver or NS in this
documentation). The networks are referred as primary and secondary network
in this document.

The secondary network is required only by the ebtables tests which also
require the creation of a bridge (logical) device on the TOE to which
the secondary network's Ethernet (physical) device on this machine
is enslaved. Please note that the both IPv4 and IPv6 needs to be properly
configured on the devices.

A working network configuration with examples of simple IPv4/IPv6 addresses
is shown on the picture below. Please note that the interfaces can be connected
directly via a cross-cable or connected to the same LAN via Ethernet switches.
Also note that while the primary and secondary networks can be on the same
physical network, they must be on separate IPv4/IPv6 subnets.

Please be aware that some network cards may be renamed by udev from the
"traditional" eth* network interface name to em* or also some other. The em*
renaming will be the default in RHEL7 for all network interfaces.

Please see section "Procedures for configuration" about details how to set
up the network configuration.

Important note:
IPv6 addresses must have global scope for the tests to work.


Testing strategy
----------------

The strategy of the testing is to provide a known and preferable empty
chain in the tables prior to the start of the testing. Then a test message is
run through the appropriate chain of the tables showing that it is not
blocking or filtering on the test message. The rule is applied with the
appropriate filter information and the test message is run through again.

The result is checked for the expected result of either the dropping,
acceptance, or rejection of the test message. Often the dropping of a message
is verified through the timeout of a listen for the message or the timeout
of a connect request. It is usually verified again via the action parameter
for the message type NETFILTER in the audit log which is rotated before
the start of each test. In the case of a chain policy drop rule the listen
or connect timeout must suffice. This is because the only way to audit a
dropped message is to insert a rule with a target of AUDIT_DROP, however
by inserting such a rule it would not verify that the drop is caused by the
policy change as opposed to the rule inserted to audit the drop.


Environmental variables
-----------------------

There are a number of environmental variables required in order to provide
the information needed to set the rules in iptables, ip6tables and ebtables.
Some of these environmental variables are also required by the network
tests in the audit-test/network directory. These environmental variables
may be set manually prior to running the tests but the process of setting them
all is simplified by the config-server.bash script. This script will ask for
the pertinent ipv4, ipv6, and MAC addresses as well as device names to which
these addresses are assigned. This allows considerable flexibility in
configuring systems with 2 or possibly several more network interfaces on
both the TOE platform as well as the network server platform.

The config-server.bash script will build a profile.<hostname> file in the
utils/netfilter directory in the audit-test suite path. This file
should be sourced prior to running the tests. It is important to pay
attention to the format and correctness of the answers. While the
config-server.bash script will echo your response to the questions and allow
you the opportunity to change your responses, it currently does no format
checking and cannot verify if an address or device name is accurate. It does
however use a profile.sample file in the same directory to provide a default
answer which is primarily provided for the purpose of giving a sample of the
format expected in the response.

Alternatively, the profile.sample may be used as a template
for the profile.<hostname> file and manually edited with the
required information.

Below is a list of the environmental variables required to run all the tests
as well as an explanation of what they are.

according to the picture shown in section "Network configuration".

TYPE="Ethernet"

For details on configuring the network interfaces in general refer to:
https://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-networkscripts-interfaces.html

Please note that in the examples above, all interfaces are configured via static
network address assignment. You may use also DHCP for configuring your devices
but static addresses are best of the DHCP addresses aren't persistent or
don't provide the subnet separation required by the tests.

If DHCP addresses are used and are not persistent, the LBLNET and SECNET
variables must be updated each time an address on the NS changes, and
the LOCAL variables must be updated if an address on the TOE changes.
A change to either server will require re-running 'make netconfig'
on the TOE and re-running the NS setup procedure described in README.netwk_svr.

After configuring the interfaces you need to restart the networking for the
changes to take effect.

On a CAPP machine, perform the following:

# service network restart

On an LSPP machine, perform:

# run_init service network restart

After restarting the network on the TOE and NS, verify the
configuration by examining the results of 'ifconfig' on each
system.  On the TOE, verify the bridge configuration with the
'brctl show' command.

Setting the aging timer to a high value is helpful to the testing as
it prevents the learned mac addresses in the bridge's forwarding database
from being deleted when it hasn't seen a frame from that mac address in the
timer number of seconds.  The following command is recommended.

# brctl setageing <bridge name> 3600

This command can be placed in /etc/rc.local to be run automatically
upon each boot.
