Installing the Network Test Server
----------------------------------

Several of the networking tests require a remote host to either connect to or
initiate a connection on the local test machine.  This remote machine is
referred to as the "network test server" and should be installed and
configured in a manner similar to the test machines.  The installation and
configuration steps are described below:

Install the network test server as if it were a test machine.  This
means that it should be in the evaluated configuration in LSPP/MLS
mode.

Install the audit-test suite, following the instructions in the README.run
file, until the "Configure the network test server" step.

Build and install the lblnet_tst_server daemon as shown below:

# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/utils/network-server
# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/utils/network-server install


Create a file /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash with
exported PASSWD variable with password for administrative user (should
match also a password for root). This is required for restarting auditd
service by lblnet_tst_server over xinetd on NS for audit-remote tests,
and LBLNET_SVR_IPV4, LBLNET_SVR_IPV6 variables with IP addresses that
should be used on NS, ie.:

# cat > /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash <<EOF
export PASSWD=<eal/root password>
export LBLNET_SVR_IPV4=10.0.0.1
export LBLNET_SVR_IPV6=fd00::1
EOF

Source the profile.bash file, exporting the variables in the current shell:

# . /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash

Configure the server with the client IP address information.

Create a file,
'/usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system/client_list.txt', hereafter
referred to as the "client address file".  This file contains the IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses of all the TOEs connecting to the network test server.  The
hash symbol, "#", can be used as a comment delimiter. Example syntax is shown
below:

# client_list.txt
#
# A file containing the IPv4|6 addresses of all the test machines

# foo.domain.com
10.0.0.2 fd00::2

# bar.domain.com
10.0.0.3 fd00::3

Generate and install the system's labeled network configuration as shown
below:

# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system install_server

NOTE: Whenever TOE's IP address changes, the steps above need to be re-done
(sourcing profile.bash, editing client_list.txt and performing install_server).


Reboot the network test server or run the following commands:

# service xinetd restart
# service mcstrans restart
# service netlabel restart
# service ipsec restart
# /etc/rc.local
