Installing the Network Test Server
----------------------------------

Several of the networking tests require a remote host to either connect to or
initiate a connection on the local test machine.  This remote machine is
referred to as the "network test server" and should be installed and
configured in a manner similar to the test machines.  The installation and
configuration steps are described below:

Install the network test server as if it were a test machine.  This
means that it should be in the evaluated configuration in LSPP/MLS
mode.

The network test server can be installed as a Virtual Machine as the essential
part of it is providing a software (network) reference point for the
test machine, meaning its exact hardware requirements are relaxed.

Install the audit-test suite, following the instructions in the README.run
file, until the "Configure the network test server" step.

Build and install the lblnet_tst_server daemon as shown below:

# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/utils/network-server
# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/utils/network-server install


Create a file /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash with
exported LBLNET_SVR_IPV4 and LBLNET_SVR_IPV6 variables with IP addresses that
should be used on NS, ie.:

# cat > /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash <<EOF
export LBLNET_SVR_IPV4=10.0.0.1
export LBLNET_SVR_IPV6=fd00::1
EOF

Source the profile.bash file, exporting the variables in the current shell:

# . /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/profile.bash

Configure the server with the client IP address information.

Create a file,
'/usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system/client_list.txt', hereafter
referred to as the "client address file".  This file contains the IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses of all the TOEs connecting to the network test server.  The
hash symbol, "#", can be used as a comment delimiter. Example syntax is shown
below:

# client_list.txt
#
# A file containing the IPv4|6 addresses of all the test machines

# foo.domain.com
10.0.0.2 fd00::2

# bar.domain.com
10.0.0.3 fd00::3

Generate and install the system's labeled network configuration as shown
below:

# make -C /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system install_server

NOTE: Whenever TOE's IP address changes, the steps above need to be re-done
(sourcing profile.bash, editing client_list.txt and performing install_server).


For the localhost ipsec tests to succeed, check that you have both following
tunables set to 0:

# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/disable_{xfrm,policy}

if not, add sysctl.conf entries to make them 0:

# echo "net.ipv4.conf.lo.disable_xfrm = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# echo "net.ipv4.conf.lo.disable_policy = 0" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
# sysctl -p


Now you can perform an optional system reboot to make sure all services start
properly with their newconfiguration files.
This is optional as these services should have been restarted by appropriate
Makefiles during the above steps and therefore no action should be needed here.
