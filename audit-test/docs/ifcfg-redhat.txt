Assuming the original /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 looked like

DEVICE="eth0"
TYPE="Ethernet"
HWADDR="00:11:22:33:44:55"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPADDR="10.0.0.2"
PREFIX="24"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6ADDR="fd00::2"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"

transform this file into two, ifcfg-testbr with IP addresses and leave only
minimal skeleton in ifcfg-eth0

# ifcfg-testbr
DEVICE="testbr"
TYPE="Bridge"
BOOTPROTO="static"
IPADDR="10.0.0.2"
PREFIX="24"
IPV6INIT="yes"
IPV6ADDR="fd00::2"
IPV6_AUTOCONF="no"
ONBOOT="yes"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"

# ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE="eth0"
TYPE="Ethernet"
HWADDR="00:11:22:33:44:55"
BRIDGE="testbr"
ONBOOT="yes"
NM_CONTROLLED="yes"

and ideally reboot the system (or perform 'service NetworkManager restart').

(For reference, see /usr/share/doc/initscripts-*/sysconfig.txt.)

Note that the examples above use a static configuration, but you're free to use
DHCP as well if you can configure it to provide stable addresses. The only part
the tests care about is eth0 enslaved in a bridge, so that 'ebtables' work.
