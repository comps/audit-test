RELRO (and others) system-wide scanner
======================================

This tool scans the entire system (excl. /dev, /proc, /sys) for ELF binaries
and analyzes them for various security-related ELF-specific features, mainly
relro ("relocation read-only"). See the (simple) source for more info.

To generate out.log and out.err, simply:

make run

To clean the generated log outputs:

make clean

Note that the outputs may (will) contain false relro positives, which can be
ignored based on your specific needs, for example:

- kernel modules (/lib/modules)
- grub2 modules (/boot/grub2)
- object files (*.o)
- binary "archives" (*.a)
- firmware / alsa firmware blobs
- etc.
