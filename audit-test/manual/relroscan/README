RELRO (and others) system-wide scanner
======================================

This tool scans the entire system (excl. /dev, /proc, /sys) for ELF binaries
and analyzes them for various security-related ELF-specific features, mainly
relro ("relocation read-only"). See the (simple) source for more info.

SELinux considerations
----------------------
Before running the tool, make sure the system is in SELinux Permissive mode
or has SELinux disabled, so that the tool can reach all files on the system.
You can temporarily set SELinux to Permissive with:

setenforce 0

(To enable it back, use "setenforce 1".)
With SELinux MLS policy and sysadm_secadm module disabled, only the secadm_r
role can switch enforcing modes. In this case, you need to issue:

newrole -r secadm_r -- -c 'setenforce 0'

Building and execution
----------------------
To generate out.log and out.err, simply:

make run

To clean the generated log outputs:

make clean

Note that the outputs may (will) contain false relro positives, which can be
ignored based on your specific needs, for example:

- kernel modules (/lib/modules)
- grub2 modules (/boot/grub2)
- object files (*.o)
- binary "archives" (*.a)
- firmware / alsa firmware blobs
- etc.
