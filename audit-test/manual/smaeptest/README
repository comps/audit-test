Simple x86 SMAP/SMEP test
=========================

This test verifies SMAP/SMEP functionality using a kernel module, "smaeptest",
and a userspace application.

A successful denial by SMAP/SMEP results in kernel oops / panic.

# ensure you have the necessary packages in addition to what audit-test needs:
yum -y install kernel-devel

# build
make

# load
insmod smaeptest.ko

# mount debugfs
mkdir debug/
mount -t debugfs none debug/

# do a sync to limit data loss
sync

# test SMAP
./user debug/smaeptest/smap

# test SMEP
./user debug/smaeptest/smep


Notes for RHEL-7.1 CCC
======================

Please ignore SMAP at this point as only SMEP is claimed, therefore skip the
"test SMAP" command above. Once again, as written above, a successful test PASS
is considered a machine crash (because the crash prevented unsafe execution).
