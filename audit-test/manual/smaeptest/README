Simple x86 SMAP/SMEP test
=========================

This test verifies SMAP/SMEP functionality using a kernel module, "smaeptest",
and a userspace application.

A successful denial by SMAP/SMEP results in kernel oops / panic.

# ensure you have the necessary packages in addition to what audit-test needs:
yum -y install kernel-devel

# build
make

# load
insmod smaeptest.ko

# mount debugfs
mkdir debug/
mount -t debugfs none debug/

# do a sync to limit data loss
sync

# test SMAP
./user debug/smaeptest/smap

# test SMEP
./user debug/smaeptest/smep


RHEL-7.1 instructions
---------------------
For RHEL-7.1, only SMEP is expected to work, SMAP is not part of the
certification (as it's not supported by the certified hardware).

Only the x86_64 architecture and only certain Intel processors
from microarchitecture "Haswell" (or "Ivy Bridge" for Xeon CPUs) onwards
have this feature.

On these configurations, the SMEP test as described above should freeze
the machine (OS), preventing unauthorized execution. If it does not,
ie. if the machine continues to operate normally, the test failed and
SMEP doesn't work.
