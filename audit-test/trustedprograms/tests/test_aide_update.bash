# PURPOSE:
# Verify that aide will successfully notice an updated file, and that it
# reports an audit event about the change.  To test this first a database
# is created and then moved into place.  A test file is created and then is
# updated by changing its mls level to Secret and aide is re-run.  The
# test is successful if aide notices the change and issues an audit of
# the difference
