#
# PREREQUISITES:
# Configured screen according to the CCC requirements.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# The test checks if
# + screen locked after specific amount of time
# + screen asking for password
# + unlock successful using the correct password
# + unlock fails using an incorrect password
# + screen asks again for the password if attempt failed
# + escape sequence for clearing the screen sent if screen locked
# + kernel boot options contain "no-scroll" and "fbcon=scrollback:0"
# + screen locking via "CTRL-A x" works
# + control sequences (CTRL-C, CTRL-D, CTRL-A d)
#   do not work when screen locked
#
# NOTE:
# During the test the sleep command from /etc/profile is removed
# so the test can run in a reasonable time frame. The changed
# file is restored after the testing.
