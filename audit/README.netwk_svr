README.netwk_svr: Installing the Network Test Server

Several of the networking tests require a remote host to either connect to or 
initiate a connection on the local test machine.  This remote machine is to 
be referred to as the "network test server" and should be installed and 
configured in a manner similar to the test machines.  The installation and 
configuration steps are described below:

1. Install the network test server as if it were a test machine.

2. A new test user should be added to the system using the commands below:

      # useradd â€“m eal_test
      # passwd eal_test

3. After the standard test installation and setup is complete, build and 
install the lblnet_tst_server daemon as shown below:

      # cd /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/utils/network-server
      # make
      # make install

4. Create a file, 
'/usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system/client_list.txt', hereafter 
referred to as the "client address file".  This file contains the IPv4 and 
IPv6 addresses of all the clients connecting to the network test server.  The 
hash symbol, "#", can be used as a comment delimiter. Example syntax is shown 
below:

      # client_list.txt
      #
      # A file containing the IPv4|6 addresses of all the test machines

      # foo.domain.com
      1.2.3.4
      1::2
      # bar.domain.com
      5.6.7.8
      3::4

5. Set the LBLNET_PREFIX_IPV6 environment variable to the IPV6 prefix to be 
used for testing.  An example variable value is "fd7b:826d:00f2::/64".

6. Generate and install the system's labeled network configuration as shown 
below:

      # newrole -r lspp_test_r
      # cd /usr/local/eal4_testing/audit-test/network/system
      # make install_server

NOTE: This step, as well as step 7, should be repeated whenever the client 
address file changes.

7. Reboot the network test server or run the following command:
	
      run_init /etc/rc.local
