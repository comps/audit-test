This test suite is known to work with RHEL4 Update 2 when
configured according to the HP Evaluated Configuration Guide.
It was tested with the x86, x86_64 and ia64 architectures.
Code exists for other architectures but no other architectures
have been tested with this version of the test suite.  

Current TODO items:

- Rewrite libpam tests in bash
- Rewrite trustedprograms tests in bash
- Update syscall tests for fsetxattr, fchmod, fchown, fremovexattr to
  use context_settobj() instead of audit_add_watch()
- Add more filesystem audit unit tests: link and symlink handling,
  file replacement, etc.
- Improve code for dropping privs in syscall tests
- Make all references to struct audit_data via accessors (syscall tests)
- Update tests to run on FC5/RHEL5
- Update tests for LSPP coverage 
- Introduce stackable test execution modes: capp, lspp, etc.
