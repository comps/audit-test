This test suite is known to work with RHEL4 Update 2 when
configured according to the HP Evaluated Configuration Guide.
It was tested with the x86, x86_64 and ia64 architectures.
Code exists for other architectures but no other architectures
have been tested with this version of the test suite.  

Current TODO items:

- Fix failsafe tests
- Add more filesystem audit unit tests: watch persistence, open existing
  file/symlink
- syscalls tests use bash infrastructure
- Update tests for LSPP coverage 
- Introduce stackable test execution modes: capp, lspp, etc. (mostly done)

Improvement items:

- Move exit_pass, exit_fail and exit_error to testcase.bash; they aren't
  intended to be used outside of a testcase
- Extract audit-specific stuff from run.bash.  The script is mostly generic and
  could be used in any test suite, but presently it has a few audit things in
  it.
