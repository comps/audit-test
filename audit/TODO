This test suite is known to work with RHEL5 when configured
according to the HP Evaluated Configuration Guide.  It was tested
with the x86, x86_64 and ia64 architectures.  Code exists for
other architectures but no other architectures have been tested
with this version of the test suite.  

Current TODO items:

- fix all tests to use prepend_cleanup/append_cleanup correctly
- Add more filesystem audit unit tests: watch persistence, open existing
  file/symlink
- add tests for syscall classes
- re-write syscalls tests use bash infrastructure in syscalls2

Improvement items:

- Extract audit-specific stuff from run.bash.  The script is mostly generic and
  could be used in any test suite, but presently it has a few audit things in
  it.
