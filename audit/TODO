This test suite is known to work with RHEL5 when configured
according to the HP Evaluated Configuration Guide.  It was tested
with the x86, x86_64 and ia64 architectures.  Code exists for
other architectures but no other architectures have been tested
with this version of the test suite.  

Current TODO items:

- Conditionalize tests on the various versions of audit records (esp. libpam and
  trustedprograms tests).
- Conditionalize tests based on audit package releases.
- Update test coverage reports.

Improvement items:

- Extract audit-specific stuff from run.bash.  The script is mostly generic and
  could be used in any test suite, but presently it has a few audit things in
  it.
