The KVM Audit Test exports a set of environment variables to facilitate the
development of test cases. These environment variables are:

- first, last

  These variables contain the first and last numbers used in sequences. The
  last variable is equal to the number of virtual machine environments to
  install/start prior to execution of test cases.


- key

  This variable contains a filter key to use in audit rules.


- offset

  This variable contains the current audit log offset (total size, in bytes).


- pids, pids_count

  This variable contains the process IDs of the processes representing virtual
  machine environments.


- users, users_count

  This variable contains the user IDs of the processes representing virtual
  machine environments.


- labels, labels_count

  This variable contains the SELinux security contexts of the processes
  representing virtual machine environments.


- contexts, contexts_count

  This variable contains the SELinux security contexts of the resources
  associated with the processes representing virtual machine environments.


- label_users, label_roles, label_types, label_levls

  These variables contain the user, role, type, and level of the SELinux
  security contexts of the processes representing virtual machine
  environments.


- context_users, context_roles, context_types, context_levls

  These variables contain the user, role, type and level of the SELinux
  security contexts of the resources associated with the processes
  representing virtual machine environments.


- kvm_guest_N_pid

  This variable contains the process ID of the specified process representing
  a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_user

  This variable contains the user ID of the specified process representing a
  virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_label

  This variable contains the SELinux security context of the speciied process
  representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_context

  This variable contains the SELinux security context of the resource
  associated with the specified process representing a virtual machine
  environment.


- kvm_guest_N_label_user, kvm_guest_N_label_role,
  kvm_guest_N_label_type, kvm_guest_N_label_levl

  These variables contain the user, role, type and level of the SELinux
  security context of the specified process representing a virtual machine
  environment.


- kvm_guest_N_context_user, kvm_guest_N_context_role,
  kvm_guest_N_context_type, kvm_guest_N_context_levl

  These variables contain the user, role, type and level of the SELinux
  security context of the resource associated with the specified process
  representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_resource

  This variable contains the resource associated with the specified process
  representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_config

  This variable contains the configuration associated with the specified
  process representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_live_config

  This variable contains the live configuration associated with the specified
  process representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_addr

  This variable contains the IP address associated with the specified process
  representing a virtual machine environment.


- kvm_guest_N_hostaddr

  This variable contains the host IP address of the virtual network associated
  with the specified process representing a virtual machine environment.
