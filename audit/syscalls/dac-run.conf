## SYSCALL:	open()
## PURPOSE:
## Verify audit of attempts to open or create new files in the filesystem.
## There are three types of testcases in this set of tests.  The first, using the
## 'perm=dir_add_name' variable, tries to create a new file in a directory which
## may or may not be accessible to the test process executing the open()
## syscall.  The second, using the 'perm=file_read' variable, tries to open a
## file for reading for which the test process may or may not have read
## permission.  The third, using the 'perm=file_write' variable, tries to open a
## file for writing for which the test process may or may not have write
## permission.  The test procedure is as follows:
## 1a. If perm=dir_add_name, create a new directory and make it only
##     accessible to the directory owner.
## 1b. If perm=file_read, create a file which is only read-accessible to the
##     file owner.
## 1c. If perm=file_write, create a file which is only write-accessible to the
##     file owner.
## 2a. If expres=success, execute the test process as the directory or file
##     owner and attempt the open() syscall using the value of flag to
##     determine whether to create a new file or open an existing file for read
##     or write; verify the result.
## 2b. If expres=fail, execute the test process as another user and
##     attempt the open() syscall using the value of flag to determine whether
##     to create a new file or open an existing file for read or write; verify
##     the result.

## SYSCALL:	rename()
## PURPOSE:
## Verify audit of attempts to change the name or location of a file in the
## filesystem.  There are three types of testcases in this set of tests.  The
## first, using the 'perm=dir_remove_name,which=old' variables, creates the
## original file in a parent directory which may or may not be accessible to the
## test process and tries to move this file into a new directory.  The second
## test, using the 'perm=dir_add_name' variable, creates a new parent directory
## which may or may not be accessible to the test process and tries to move the
## original file into this new directory.  The third test, using the
## 'perm=dir_remove_name,which=new' variables, creates a parent directory which
## may or may not be accessible to the test process and tries to rename a file
## to the name of an existing file in that directory.  The test procedure is as
## follows:
##  1.  Create a new parent directory for the original object. If
##      perm=dir_remove_name,which=old then make it only accessible to the
##	directory owner.
##  2.  Create the original object.
##  3.  Create a new parent directory for the new location. If perm=dir_add_name
##      or perm=dir_remove_name,which=new then make it only accessible to the
##      directory owner.
##  4.  If perm=dir_remove_name,which=new then create a file at the new location.
##  5a. If expres=success, execute the test process as the directory owner and
## 	attempt the rename() syscall, verify the result
##  5b. If expres=fail, execute the test process as another user and attempt the
##      rename() syscall, verify the result

## PURPOSE:
## Verify audit of attempts to perform semaphore operations.  The test
## cases below try to perform a read operation on a semaphore in a set which may
## or may not be accessible to the test process.  The test procedure is as
## follows:
## 1.  Create a semaphore set which is only read-accessible to the semaphore set
##     owner.
## 2a. If expres=success, execute the test process as the semaphore set
##     owner and attempt a read operation, verify the result
## 2b. If expres=fail, execute the test process as another user and attempt a
##     read operation, verify the result
## 3.  Check the audit log for the correct syscall result

## PURPOSE:
## Verify audit of attempts to perform shared memory operations.  The test
## cases below try to perform shared memory operations on a shared memory
## segment which may or may not be accessible to the test process.  The test
## procedure is as follows:
## 1a. If perm=shm_key_read, create a shared memory segment which is only
##     read-accessible to the shared memory segment owner.
## 1b. If perm=shm_key_write, create a shared memory segment which is only
##     write-accessible to the shared memory segment owner.
## 2a. If expres=success, execute the test process as the shared memory segment
##     owner and attempt the syscall using the value of perm to determine
##     whether to perform a read or write operation; verify the result
## 2b. If expres=fail, execute the test process as another user and attempt the
##     syscall using the value of perm to determine whether to perform a read or
##     write operation; verify the result
## 3.  Check the audit log for the correct syscall result

## SYSCALL:     shmget(), ipc()
## PURPOSE:
## Verify audit of attempts to get a shared memory id.  There are two types of
## testcases in this set of tests. The first, using the 'perm=shm_key_read'
## variable, tries to open a shared memory segment for read operations which may
## or may not be read-accessible to the test process.  The second, using the
## 'perm=shm_key_write' variable, tries to open a shared memory segment for
## write operations which may or may not be write-accessible to the test
## process.  The test procedure is as follows:
## 1a. If perm=shm_key_read, create a shared memory segment which is only
##     read-accessible to the shared memory segment owner.
## 1b. If perm=shm_key_write, create a shared memory segment which is only
##     write-accessible to the shared memory segment owner.
## 2a. If expres=success, execute the test process as the shared memory segment
##     owner and attempt the syscall using the value of flag to determine
##     whether to request the shared memory segment for read or write; verify
##     the result.
## 2b. If expres=fail, execute the test process as another user and attempt the
##     syscall using the value of flag to determine whether to request the
##     shared memory segment for read or write; verify the result.
## 3.  Check the audit log for the correct syscall result
