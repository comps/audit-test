#  FILE   : test_cron_set_invalid_mls_level.bash
#
#
#  TEST DESCRIPTION: Test that the MLS cron functionality works as
#                    expected. Create a crontab as a normal user, add a job,
#                    and set the MLS_LEVEL environment variable to a level
#                    outside the user's allowed range. Verify that cron does
#                    not execute the job.
