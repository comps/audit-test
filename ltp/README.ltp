| Running LTP tests
+------------------

Notes
-----
LTP source code is automatically downloaded during the make phase.

If you do not have internet connection, please place the
LTP sources as ltp-full.tar.bz2 to this directory. The download
will be skipped if the sources are present. Note that a
'make clean' will remove the LTP source file.

You can find the LTP release tarballs on sourceforge.

Requirements
------------
Be sure to have properly configured the system according to the README.run
from the audit-test suite.

Log in as the eal user.

If running on an LSPP/MLS system, change to the 'lspp_test_r' role.

# newrole -r lspp_test_r

For all configurations, 'su' to root.

# /bin/su -

The LTP tests require that the PASSWD environment variable be exported
with root's password.

# export PASSWD=<root passwd>

Running
-------
Running required LTP tests is fully automated.

The LTP suite is built and installed during the make phase. The tests
are executed during the make run phase.

To run the LTP tests in the native mode for the platform (64-bit or
32-bit) use the commands below.

# make
# make run

To run the LTP tests in 32-bit mode on a 64-bit platform, use the
commands below.

# make clean (see the note above regarding the LTP source file)
# make MODE=32
# make MODE=32 run

The logs from each test run are stored in the run.log and rollup.log files.

Expected test results for RHEL6.2 / LTP 20110915
------------------------------------------------
When the tests are run in the native mode for the OS, all the
tests should pass.  When the tests are run in 32-bit mode on
a 64-bit OS, the following tests are expected to fail:

syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl11_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl14_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl17_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl19_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl20_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fcntl21_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fstat02_64
syscalls.rollup.log:fstat04_64
syscalls.rollup.log:ftruncate01_64
syscalls.rollup.log:ftruncate02_64
syscalls.rollup.log:ftruncate04_64
syscalls.rollup.log:lstat03_64
syscalls.rollup.log:nftw6401
syscalls.rollup.log:pwrite04_64
syscalls.rollup.log:sendfile02_64
syscalls.rollup.log:sendfile06_64
syscalls.rollup.log:stat01_64
syscalls.rollup.log:stat02_64
syscalls.rollup.log:truncate01_64
syscalls.rollup.log:truncate02_64

On s390x the posix_fadvise03 and posixfadvise03_64 tests are expected
to fail.  The test expects the test to fail due to an invalid advise value.
Since more advise values are defined on s390, the syscall unexpectedly passes.
