# This command loads a delegate table row blob into a non-volatile
# delegate table in the TPM. Tspi_TPM_Delegate_CacheOwnerDelegation
# can be used during manufacturing or on first boot (when no Owner
# is installed), or after an Owner is installed. If an Owner is
# installed, Tspi_TPM_Delegate_CacheOwnerDelegation requires Owner
# authorization.
