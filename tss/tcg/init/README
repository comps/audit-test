The files contained in this directory are a conglomeration of testcases
that need to be run interactively because of various circumstances.

For example, the Tspi_TPM_SetStatus_TempDeactivated01 testcase will
temporarily deactivate the TPM and pretty much cause all commands sent
to the TPM to fail.  A reboot is required to re-activate the TPM at
this point.
